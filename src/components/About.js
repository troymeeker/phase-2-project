       <h3> Our Mission is to save as many animals as possible and help them find forever homes by giving them fresh starts regardless of their past. </h3>
       <p>Many of our animals are rescued from other countries (Mexico, Korea) as well as kill shelters within the US.</p>
       <p>Since we do not use a physical shelter, we rely on fosters, volunteers and word of mouth to keep the animals we find in safe homes as quickly as possible.</p>
       <p> Every dog our rescue organization accepts will be spayed/neutered, treated for parasites, checked and treated for any medical conditions, microchipped, and given all vaccinations. We rely on donations, grants, and loyal supporters to continue our rescue mission.</p>
